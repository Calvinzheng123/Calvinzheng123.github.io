Hi, I’m Calvin Zheng, a Data Science student at UNC Charlotte (Class of 2026). I’m passionate about data visualization, forecasting, and machine learning, and I’m currently a Data Analytics Co-op at Collins Aerospace. This portfolio will showcase my projects in coding, industry tools, and design-focused storytelling as I build my skills this semester.
