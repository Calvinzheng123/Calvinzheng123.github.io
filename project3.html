      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        This project is a design-focused evolution of my Amazon Product Engagement dashboard. The goal was not just to
        build a functional dashboard, but to create a <span class="font-semibold">portfolio-ready story</span> with
        intentional color, layout, audience targeting, and narrative flow.

    <!-- Audience & Intent -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow border">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Audience &amp; Intent</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        The dashboard is designed for <span class="font-semibold">Amazon category and merchandising managers</span>
        deciding where to invest in coupons, discounts, and sponsored placements. The core question is:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-800 italic">
        “For a given slice of the catalog, are we facing a visibility problem or a satisfaction problem?”
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        I want the audience to:
      </p>
      <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1">
        <li>Quickly understand rating quality and engagement (total reviews) for a chosen slice.</li>
        <li>See how <span class="font-semibold">sponsored placements</span> and <span class="font-semibold">coupons</span> show up in purchase behavior.</li>
        <li>Run simple <span class="italic">what-if</span> scenarios around rating, pricing, and promotions.</li>
        <li>Walk away with a mental model: high rating + low reviews = under-exposed, low rating + purchases = risk.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Story & Structure -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow border">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Story &amp; Structure</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        The dashboard is structured as a linear story so users don’t have to guess where to look:
      </p>
      <ol class="mt-3 list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Hero + KPIs:</span> A dark Amazon-style header and four metrics
          (average rating, total reviews, average discount, best-seller share) give a quick read on overall health
          for the filtered slice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Rating distribution:</span> A histogram shows whether this slice is mostly
          high quality or noisy. This builds trust in the slice before introducing promotions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Purchases vs rating (sponsored vs organic):</span> A scatter plot of
          <code>purchased_last_month</code> vs <code>product_rating</code>, colored by placement
          (<span class="italic">Sponsored ad</span> vs <span class="italic">Organic result</span>), reveals how
          promos and exposure shift behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">What-if prediction tool:</span> A small panel lets the user plug in rating,
          price, discount, coupon, sponsorship, and category, then returns a predicted number of total reviews.
          This moves the story from descriptive to prescriptive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Model diagnostics (log–log view):</span> An expandable section shows
          actual vs predicted reviews in log–log space, with R² and MAE. This gives technically-minded users a
          sense of reliability without cluttering the main story.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700">
        Overall, the flow is: <span class="font-semibold">overview → quality → behavior → action → reliability</span>,
        which matches how a manager would reason through decisions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Design Choices -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow border">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Design Choices</h2>

      <h3 class="mt-2 text-base font-semibold text-gray-900">Color &amp; Theme</h3>
      <p class="mt-1 text-gray-700">
        I used an Amazon-inspired <span class="font-semibold">dark theme</span>:
        navy backgrounds (<code>#131921</code> / <code>#232F3E</code>), orange accents (<code>#FF9900</code>),
        and light text. This keeps the dashboard visually cohesive and aligns it with a recognizable brand.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-1 text-gray-700">
        Plotly is configured with a dark template so axes, labels, and gridlines remain readable on the dark background.
        Sponsored vs organic products use distinct categorical colors; coupon status is shown in hover tooltips instead
        of adding more legend entries.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-base font-semibold text-gray-900">Layout &amp; Hierarchy</h3>
      <p class="mt-1 text-gray-700">
        The dashboard uses a single, vertical column with clear section headers (1–4). KPIs sit at the top as an
        “at-a-glance” summary. Each subsequent section answers a more detailed question:
        <span class="italic">Is this slice trustworthy?</span>,
        <span class="italic">How do promos show up?</span>,
        <span class="italic">What happens if I change levers?</span>,
        <span class="italic">Can I trust the model?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="mt-1 text-gray-700">
        Short captions under each chart explain how a manager should use it (e.g., “High rating, low purchases:
        good candidates for coupons or sponsorship.”). This guides attention without forcing the user to read a long report.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-base font-semibold text-gray-900">Clutter Reduction</h3>
      <p class="mt-1 text-gray-700">
        I intentionally limited the main visuals to:
        a histogram, a scatter, a small what-if form + metric, and one diagnostic chart inside an expander.
        Extra detail (product title, total reviews, discount percent, coupon label) lives in hover tooltips.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-1 text-gray-700">
        Categories are capped to the top 30 with an “Other” bucket so the filters and legends stay readable and
        don’t turn into a wall of labels.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-base font-semibold text-gray-900">Perception &amp; Accessibility</h3>
      <p class="mt-1 text-gray-700">
        Quantitative variables use position (x/y) rather than color intensity, which matches how humans perceive
        differences best. Color is reserved for categorical distinctions (placement) and occasional highlighting.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-1 text-gray-700">
        The dark theme uses high-contrast text for readability, and the scatter plots use SVG rendering instead of
        WebGL to avoid browser-specific rendering issues and warnings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Reflection -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow border">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Reflection</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        <span class="font-semibold">What worked well:</span>
        tying each visual to a concrete decision (protect top performers, promote high-rated low-visibility items,
        and sanity-check promo ideas) made the dashboard feel practical instead of academic. The Amazon-style dark
        theme helped it look closer to a real internal tool.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        <span class="font-semibold">What was challenging:</span>
        the hardest part was balancing interactivity and focus. It was tempting to add time-series charts,
        product-level drilldowns, and more filters, but that would have diluted the narrative and made the dashboard
        feel like a control panel instead of a story.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        <span class="font-semibold">What I would refine with more time:</span>
        I would add time-based views around promo changes (before/after sponsorship or coupons), segment products
        by lifecycle (new launches vs long-tail items), and expose simple scenario presets in the prediction tool
        (for example, “new launch with intro coupon” vs “mature product with no promo”) to make the what-if workflow faster.
      </p>

    <!-- Transparency -->

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Access &amp; Transparency</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        The live dashboard is hosted on Streamlit and linked at the top of this page. The underlying code and data
        pipelines are available in my project repository (and can be shared on request).
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        I used ChatGPT to help debug deployment issues (model loading, theming) and to iterate on the wording of the
        design report. The modeling choices, feature engineering, and final visual structure are my own; AI was used
        as a support tool, not as the source of the analysis.
