          <p class="mt-1">
            This dashboard is designed for Amazon category and merchandising managers who need to decide
            where to focus promotions, coupons, and sponsored placements. The core question is:
            <span class="font-medium">given a slice of the catalog, are we facing a visibility problem or a satisfaction problem?</span>
          </p>
          <p class="mt-1">
            The intent is to help them quickly assess rating quality and engagement for a chosen slice,
            see how sponsorship and coupons show up in behavior, and run simple
            <span class="italic">what-if</span> checks on pricing and promo setups to estimate expected total reviews.

          <h3 class="text-base font-semibold text-gray-900">Story &amp; Structure</h3>
          <p class="mt-1">
            The layout follows a top-to-bottom narrative so the audience doesn’t have to hunt for meaning:
          </p>
          <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              <span class="font-medium">Hero + KPIs:</span> headline and metrics (avg rating, total reviews, avg discount, best-seller share)
              give a fast read on the slice’s overall health.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-medium">Rating distribution:</span> histogram shows whether the slice is mostly high quality
              or noisy, building trust before we talk about promos.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-medium">Purchases vs. rating (sponsored vs. organic):</span>
              scatter plot connects performance to levers managers can control (ads and coupons),
              highlighting high-rating/low-visibility opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-medium">What-if prediction tool:</span>
              lets users plug in rating, pricing, coupon, and sponsorship status, then returns a predicted number of total reviews.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-medium">Model diagnostics:</span>
              optional log–log view of actual vs. predicted reviews plus R² and MAE, for users who care about model reliability.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-1">
            This structure moves from overview → quality → behavior → action → reliability, which matches how a manager would
            naturally reason through decisions.

        <section>
          <h3 class="text-base font-semibold text-gray-900">Design Choices</h3>
          <p class="mt-1">
            <span class="font-medium">Color:</span> I used an Amazon-inspired palette: dark navy backgrounds, orange accents,
            and neutral grays. Sponsored vs. organic products get distinct categorical colors, while coupon status is
            revealed in hover tooltips instead of adding another color channel. This keeps the legend simple and avoids
            over-encoding.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-1">
            <span class="font-medium">Layout &amp; hierarchy:</span>
            The dashboard stays in a single column: KPIs → distribution → relationship → what-if → diagnostics.
            Section headers and short explanatory captions under each chart guide the viewer’s attention and make the
            “intended reading path” explicit.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-1">
            <span class="font-medium">Clutter reduction:</span>
            I limited the main visuals to two analytical charts plus one what-if tool, with diagnostics tucked into an expander.
            Rich details (product title, total reviews, discount, coupon label) live in Plotly hover tooltips, so the
            default view stays clean.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-1">
            <span class="font-medium">Perception &amp; accessibility:</span>
            I use position for quantitative variables (rating, purchases), color for categorical placement (sponsored vs. organic),
            and consistent rating scales from 0–5. A dark theme with light text improves contrast, and the plots use a
            dark template so axis labels and annotations are readable against the background.

        <!-- Reflection -->
        <section>
          <h3 class="text-base font-semibold text-gray-900">Reflection</h3>
          <p class="mt-1">
            <span class="font-medium">What worked well:</span>
            grounding every visual in a concrete decision (protect top performers, promote hidden gems, sanity-check promo ideas)
            and tying the aesthetics to Amazon’s brand made the dashboard feel closer to a real internal tool than a class demo.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-1">
            <span class="font-medium">What was challenging:</span>
            the hardest part was balancing interactivity and focus. It was tempting to add more filters and charts
            (like time-series views), but that would have diluted the main story, so I kept the scope tight.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-1">
            <span class="font-medium">Future improvements:</span>
            with more time, I would add time-based trends around promo changes, segment products by lifecycle
            (new launches vs. long-tail items), and expose simple scenario presets in the prediction tool
            (for example, “new launch with intro coupon” vs. “mature product without promo”).
